# MolecularDynamics
A basic code to compute thermodynamic properties of gas particles in a box

So this is my first molecular dynamics simulation code.
Lennard jones potential has been simulated in this project. 

Code is written quite straight forward and is well structured. Anyone can go through it if having any trouble regarding lennard jones potential.
